🎮 GTA 6-Inspired UI — Built with React.js

“Not a game. Not a clone. Just pure frontend creativity.”

Inspired by the vibrant and high-energy aesthetic of GTA 6, this project is a front-end UI experiment built using React.js and CSS.  
It’s designed to capture the bold, neon-soaked vibes of Rockstar's upcoming release — focusing purely on interface, design, transitions,
and a rich user experience.

This is my attempt at mixing creative design with clean, modern frontend architecture.
